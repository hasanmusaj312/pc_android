ABOUT PING

Have you ever been somewhere such as a coffee shop and seen someone you would like to approach but couldn't quite get up the nerve?

PingConnects allows you to be at any location and instantly see who else is on ping, who's available and looking for that special someone or who just wants to find a new friend.

Simply swipe through the photos and if you see someone you'd like to meet, send them one of the preprogrammed “greetings“. You can also send them a personalized message through the chatbox.

Then they can reply from the preprogrammed “response list“ or chat back with you. You get an instant response! It's that simple.

No more missed opportunities!
